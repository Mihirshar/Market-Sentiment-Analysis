# PETSA (Product Efficiency Through Sentiment Analyser)

PETSA (Product Efficiency Through Sentiment Analyser) is a tool that allows any company to get realtime update and efficiency of there productsin the market. It also tell about the coverage of the products in market caps.

## Leverage Machine Learning for PETSA

* <b>Question Analysis</b>
The project gives the result of the efficiency of any product. To analyze whether the product is efficient or not, we have to analyze the sentiments of the comments done by any person. It also depends on the sentiments of the tweet of any person for the product. The sentiment divided into three categories, i.e. positive, negative, and neutral.
&nbsp;
* <b>Metric to Predict</b>
The product has buyers and buyers have general opinions. Humans use to tell their general opinions using sentences over social media like Twitter as well as the sites from where they use to shop the product like Amazon, Flipkart. We have to gather all the data of any product over the different platforms. We have to analyze and predict the sentiment of any hashtag, any mentions, or any sentence for any product.
&nbsp;
* <b>Data Input and Analysis</b>
Data is a valuable asset for this project and it is used to predict the sentiments of any person how he/she look towards the use of that product. The data come through the web servers and API of any platform. Then all the data is clean and filter out as per the use of the Model to analyze. Data is also labeled according to the words and sentiment it contains whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Depending on this label our model  analyze whether the product is efficient in the market or not
&nbsp;
* <b>Statistical Approach and Algorithm to Choose</b>
The main statistics behind this idea is to analyze the market cap undertaken by any product and to study how to get maximum profit from minimum coverage. We have to make a Recurrent Neural Network that can predict how much the product is efficient in the market.
&nbsp;
* <b>Final Output</b>
PETSA (Product Efficiency through Sentiment Analysis) is a web-based application which runs on client site and shows them about how their products are performing in the market. PETSA also deals with Hashtags, mentions, and sentences which has some sentiment regarding any product. There is a specific place to search for hashtags, mentions, or sentence for any product.
